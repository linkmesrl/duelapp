#Duelapp

Duelapp is a casual Game, created for the entertainment of a friend’s group. When a match starts, few interactions are needed to play the game: the game is designed to be addictive with a very low level of time consumption.

## The Concept
We want to create a quick multiplayer game, with minimal interactions and with a ridiculous level of time consumption.
A game which everyone could play, regardless of how busy or in hurry he is.  
And we want it to be Open Source and highly customizable: we want the designers could easily design new skins and mods, pushing the game towards new creative settings.


## Game specs
+ match duration: 1- 24h  
+ player: at least 2, much better if 10 or more  
+ requirements: Android or iOS  
+ winner: there is no winner, just one loser!  


## How to play
If you are in a match, whenever you want you can log in the app and make your move.  
Theoretically every move can increase your not-losing chances, but really, It doesn’t count how many move you do: just the last move in the match counts. So, try to be as punctual as you can.
